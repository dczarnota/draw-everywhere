Each user has a unique color that they can use to draw on the canvas and display to others.

Draw Everywhere is built with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) on the front-end and with [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) on the back-end.

Socket.io is used to setup the websockets connection.
